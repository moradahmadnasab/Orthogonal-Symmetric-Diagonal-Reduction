## ðŸ”Ž Overview
Efficient solution of generalized symmetric positive definite eigenvalue problems  
\[
A x = \lambda B x
\]
is crucial in many areas of scientific computing.  
Our work introduces some **symmetric-diagonal reduction preprocessing technique** that improves the **stability** of standard solvers, while maintaining efficiency close to optimized methods.

## âœ¨ Key Contributions
- A novel **symmetric-diagonal reduction** for generalized eigenvalue problems.  
- Demonstrates **better conditioning** and **robustness** compared to classical approaches.  
- Applicable as a **preprocessing step** to a wide range of eigenvalue solvers.
